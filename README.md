# Open-Labware

## About

This repository collects tutorials, slides, and codes developed and maintained by the Open Labware Group, a special group that aim to build equipment using open source technologies. This group is based on the grouping made during BioRTC Summer School Training held between 18th July 2022 to 28th July 2022 at the College of Medical Sciences, Yobe State University, Damaturu, Nigeria. Details about the group. We were introduced into the world of Open Science and are empowered with the knowledge needed to create our own solutions for research needs in our local institutions. Details of the learning experience could also be found [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000014) and [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pyh2r/). We learned:- 

- How to design objects for 3D printing using OpenScad and how to conduct 3D printing 
- How to put together electronic circuits using Arduino nano
- How to leverage open source knowledge to develop our own tools.

## Instructor

Andre Maia Chagas is an open science and open source hardware expert with a background in Neuroscience who has been developing affordable open science hardware and teaching others to do so via various workshops, talks and outreach events. He started [Open Neuroscience](https://open-neuroscience.com), and is a volunteer at [Trend in Africa](https://trendinafrica.org) as an open source advisor and resource person in Open Labware workshops.

He started [Open Neuroscience](https://open-neuroscience.com) and volunteer at [Trend in Africa](https://trendinafrica.org) as an open source adviser and by organizing and running Open Labware workshops.

Andre currently works at the [Department of Neurosciences](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-neuroscience/) in the University of Sussex, where he develop equipment to support research labs. For more details on those projects check the [Open Sussex Neuroscience page](https://sussex-neuroscience.github.io)

On my spare time I offer consultancy services around open science hardware through Prometheus Science. If you need to replicate a methods paper, or if youâ€™d like something custom built for your lab, get in touch!
